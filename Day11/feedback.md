** For documentation purposes I asked feedback on ChatGPT on what I can improve on my code**

### ✅ What you did well

1. **Clear function separation** – each function (`deal_card`, `calculate_score`, `compare`, etc.) has a single purpose. That’s very clean design.
2. **Special Blackjack rules handled** – you correctly check for **Blackjack (21 with 2 cards)** and adjust **Ace (11→1)** if the score goes over 21. Nice job.
3. **Replay system** – your `game_continue()` loop is reusable and neat.
4. **ASCII art integration** – makes the game feel more polished/engaging.
5. **Readable flow** – it’s easy to follow how the main game loop works (`initial_card`, choices, compare, etc.).

### ⚡ Improvements / Issues

1. **Computer never “hits”** 🃏

   * Right now, the computer only gets the initial 2 cards and never draws more.
   * In real Blackjack, the dealer must hit until they reach at least **17**.
     ✅ Fix: add a loop for the dealer after the user is done:

   ```python
   while calculate_score(computer_hand) < 17:
       computer_hand.append(deal_card())
   ```

2. **Shadowing `current_score` vs `new_score`**

   * In the `"H"` case you calculate `new_score`, but then in `"S"` you use `computer_score` which isn’t defined in that branch.
     ✅ Define `computer_score` in **both branches**, not just `"H"`.

3. **Ace handling only once**

   * Your current rule:

     ```python
     if 11 in hand and sum(hand) > 21:
         hand.remove(11)
         hand.append(1)
     ```

     only changes one `11` → `1`.
   * If the hand has **two Aces** (e.g., `[11, 11, 9]` → sum 31), it only converts one.
     ✅ Fix with a `while` loop:

   ```python
   while 11 in hand and sum(hand) > 21:
       hand.remove(11)
       hand.append(1)
   ```

4. **Code repetition in results printing**

   * You repeat printing hands/scores in both `"H"` and `"S"`.
     ✅ Suggestion: create a helper function `show_results(user_hand, computer_hand)`.

5. **Better user flow**

   * After `"H"` the game ends immediately, even if the user might want to hit again.
     ✅ You should loop asking `"Hit or Stand?"` until they either bust or stand.

### ✨ Example tweaks (focusing on dealer + ace + hit loop)

```python
def dealer_play(computer_hand):
    while calculate_score(computer_hand) < 17:
        computer_hand.append(deal_card())
    return computer_hand

def show_final(user_hand, computer_hand):
    print(f"Your final hand: {user_hand}, score: {calculate_score(user_hand)}")
    print(f"Computer's final hand: {computer_hand}, score: {calculate_score(computer_hand)}")
```

And inside your main loop:

```python
while True:
    choice = input(" [H] Hit \n [S] Stand \n [Q] Quit \n").upper()

    if choice == 'H':
        user_hand.append(deal_card())
        current_score = calculate_score(user_hand)
        print(f"Your cards: {user_hand}, score: {current_score}")
        if current_score > 21:
            print("You went over! You lose.")
            break

    elif choice == 'S':
        computer_hand = dealer_play(computer_hand)
        show_final(user_hand, computer_hand)
        print(compare(calculate_score(user_hand), calculate_score(computer_hand)))
        break

    elif choice == 'Q':
        break
```

### 📝 Summary

* ✅ Your code works really well for a first full Blackjack implementation.
* ⚡ Next step: make **dealer play properly**, allow **multiple hits**, and handle **multiple Aces**.
* ✨ Once that’s done, you’ll have a solid capstone project to be proud of.
